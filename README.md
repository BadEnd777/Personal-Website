# Personal Website

![https://badend.is-a.dev/](https://badend.is-a.dev/projects/personal-website.jpg)

Welcome to my personal website project! This repository contains the code for my personal website, where I showcase my portfolio, projects, and other information about myself.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Usage

### Development

To work on the project locally, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BadEnd777/Personal-Website.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Personal-Website
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install  # or `pnpm install` if you prefer pnpm
```

- Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev  # or `pnpm run dev` if you prefer pnpm
```

- Open your browser and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view the website locally.

### Production

To build the project for production deployment, run:

```bash
npm run build  # or `pnpm run build` if you prefer pnpm
```

The optimized production-ready assets will be generated in the `dist` directory. You can then host these files on a web server to make the website accessible online.
