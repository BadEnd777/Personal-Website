# Personal Website

![https://badend.is-a.dev/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BadEnd777/Personal-Website/main/.github/assets/preview.png)

Welcome to my personal website project! This repository contains the code for my personal website, where I showcase my portfolio, projects, and other information about myself.

The website is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool, [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/) as the JavaScript library for building user interfaces, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and improved developer experience.

The website is hosted on [https://badend.is-a.dev/](https://badend.is-a.dev/), and you can visit it to see the live version.

## Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional, but recommended)

## Technologies Used

-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) â€” Build tool for modern web development
-   [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/) â€” Performant and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€” A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Usage

### Development

To work on the project locally, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

-   Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BadEnd777/Personal-Website.git
```

> Alternatively, you can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/BadEnd777/Personal-Website/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it to a directory of your choice.

-   Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Personal-Website # or open the directory in your file explorer
```

-   Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install  # or `pnpm install` if you prefer pnpm
```

-   Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev  # or `pnpm run dev` if you prefer pnpm
```

-   Open your browser and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view the website locally.

### Production

To build the project for production deployment, run:

```bash
npm run build  # or `pnpm run build` if you prefer pnpm
```

The optimized production-ready assets will be generated in the `dist` directory. You can then host these files on a web server to make the website accessible online.
