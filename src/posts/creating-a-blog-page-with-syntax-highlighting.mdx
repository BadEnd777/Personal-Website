## How to Create a Blog Page with Syntax Highlighting

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a blog page with syntax highlighting using the following libraries:

-   `gray-matter` for front matter extraction
-   `next-mdx-remote` for rendering MDX content
-   `rehype-prism-plus` for syntax highlighting
-   A custom Prism.js CSS theme from [PrismJS Themes Repository](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)

### Set Up Your Next.js Project

Assuming you already have a Next.js project set up, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install gray-matter next-mdx-remote rehype-prism-plus
# or
yarn add gray-matter next-mdx-remote rehype-prism-plus
# or
pnpm add gray-matter next-mdx-remote rehype-prism-plus
```

### Configure Front Matter

Use `gray-matter` to extract front matter (metadata) from your MDX files. Front matter typically includes information like the title and date of the blog post. Create an MDX file with front matter like this:

```md

date: 2023-08-20

# Your MDX Content Goes Here
```

### Render MDX Content

Next, utilize `next-mdx-remote` to render the MDX content with the extracted front matter. Create a component that reads the MDX file, extracts front matter, and renders the MDX content:

```jsx
// components/BlogPost.js

import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import fs from 'fs'

const BlogPost = ({ source, frontMatter }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{frontMatter.title}</h1>
            <MDXRemote {...source} />
        </div>
    )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
    const fileContent = fs.readFileSync('path-to-your-mdx-file.md', 'utf-8')
    const { content, data } = matter(fileContent)
    const mdxSource = await serialize(content)

    return {
        props: {
            source: mdxSource,
            frontMatter: data
        }
    }
}

export default BlogPost
```

### Add Syntax Highlighting

To add syntax highlighting, we'll use the `rehype-prism-plus` library. First, install the Prism.js CSS theme from the [PrismJS Themes Repository](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes), and include it in your project.

Then, modify the `getStaticProps` function in `BlogPost.js` component to include `rehype-prism-plus`:

```jsx
// components/BlogPost.js

import rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus'

// ...

export async function getStaticProps() {
    // ...

    const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
        mdxOptions: {
            rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism]
        }
    })

    // ...
}
```

### Style Syntax Highlighting

Apply the Prism.js CSS theme to your Next.js project. You can import the CSS file in your project's main CSS file or directly in your component:

```jsx
// components/BlogPost.js

import 'path-to-your-prismjs-theme.css'
```

Now you have a blog page with syntax highlighting for your code snippets using Prism.js and the specified libraries.

Happy blogging!
