# Create a simple Facebook Messenger Chatbot with Chat Bridge

Have you ever wanted to build your own Facebook Messenger chatbot but found the process intimidating? Fear not! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a simple Facebook Messenger chatbot using Chat Bridge and Node.js. Chat Bridge is an easy-to-use library that simplifies the development of chatbots by providing a bridge between different messaging platforms.

## What is Chat Bridge?

Chat Bridge is an open-source library available on GitHub that facilitates the development of chatbots. It acts as a bridge between your application and various messaging platforms, allowing you to focus on building the bot's logic without worrying about the intricacies of different messaging APIs.

-   **GitHub Repo:** [Chat Bridge](https://github.com/Onyx-Innovators/Chat-Bridge)
-   **Documentation:** [Chat Bridge Docs](https://github.com/Onyx-Innovators/Chat-Bridge/wiki)

## Getting Started

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install Chat Bridge

Start by installing Chat Bridge using npm:

```bash
npm install chat-bridge
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Facebook App

To create a Messenger chatbot, you need a Facebook App. Follow the [official Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup) to create one.

### Step 3: Implement Your Chatbot

Now, let's create a simple chatbot using Chat Bridge. Copy the following code into your preferred Node.js environment:

```javascript
// Import the Client class
const { Client } = require('chat-bridge')

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client({
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    verifyToken: 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN'
})

// Listen for incoming messages events
client.on('message', event => {
    const { sender, message } = event

    // Send a text message back to the sender
    client.sendTextMessage(sender.id, `You wrote: ${message.text}`)
})

// Start the client
client.start(async () => {
    console.log(`Listening on ${client.page.name} (${client.page.id})`)
})
```

Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` and `'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN'` with the respective access token and verify token obtained from your Facebook App.

### Step 4: Run Your Chatbot

Save the file and run your Node.js application:

```bash
node your-file-name.js
```

Now, your chatbot is up and running, listening for incoming messages on your configured Facebook page.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just created a simple Facebook Messenger chatbot using Chat Bridge and Node.js. This is just the beginning; you can enhance your chatbot by adding more features, handling different types of messages, and integrating with external APIs.
