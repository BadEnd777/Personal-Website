## Getting Started

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install Chat Bridge

Start by installing Chat Bridge using npm:

```bash:Terminal
npm install chat-bridge
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Facebook App

To create a Messenger chatbot, you need a Facebook App. Follow the [official Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup) to create one.

### Step 3: Implement Your Chatbot

Now, let's create a simple chatbot using Chat Bridge. Copy the following code into your preferred Node.js environment:

```js:index.js
// Import the Client class
const { Client } = require('chat-bridge')

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client({
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    verifyToken: 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN'
})

// Listen for incoming messages events
client.on('message', event => {
    const { sender, message } = event

    // Send a text message back to the sender
    client.sendTextMessage(sender.id, `You wrote: ${message.text}`)
})

// Start the client
client.start(async () => {
    console.log(`Listening on ${client.page.name} (${client.page.id})`)
})
```

Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` and `'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN'` with the respective access token and verify token obtained from your Facebook App.

### Step 4: Run Your Chatbot

Save the file and run your Node.js application:

```bash:Terminal
node index.js
```

Now, your chatbot is up and running, listening for incoming messages on your configured Facebook page.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just created a simple Facebook Messenger chatbot using Chat Bridge and Node.js. This is just the beginning; you can enhance your chatbot by adding more features, handling different types of messages, and integrating with external APIs.
