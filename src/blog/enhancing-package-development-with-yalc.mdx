In the realm of package development, managing locally developed packages without publishing them to remote registries can be a daunting task. Traditional approaches like `npm link` and `yarn link` often introduce complexities and constraints, hindering productivity. Enter Yalc â€“ a game-changer for package authors seeking a seamless workflow.

## Why Yalc?

While `npm link` and `yarn link` offer a similar solution for locally developed packages, they come with their own set of challenges. Dependency resolution issues, symlink interoperability between file systems, and other constraints can impede development progress. Yalc addresses these pain points by providing a robust alternative.

## What is Yalc?

Yalc serves as a straightforward local repository for your locally developed packages, enabling seamless sharing across your development environment. Key features include:

- **Effortless Publishing**: With `yalc publish`, selectively publish only the files intended for distribution to the Yalc store, ensuring clean and efficient package distribution.
- **Dependency Injection**: Use `yalc add` to inject package content into your project, updating `package.json` with `file:` or `link:` dependencies for seamless integration.
- **Package Versioning**: Ensure consistency with a `yalc.lock` file, mirroring the functionality of `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json`.
- **Compatibility**: Yalc seamlessly integrates with projects managed by `yarn` or `npm`, offering flexibility without sacrificing compatibility.

## Installation

Getting started with Yalc is a breeze:

- Using npm:

```shell
npm i yalc -g
```

- Using Yarn:

```shell
yarn global add yalc
```

## Usage

### Publish

Publish your package to the Yalc store:

```shell
yalc publish
```

### Add

Inject package content into your project:

```shell
yalc add my-package
```

### Link

Create a symlink to package content:

```shell
yalc link my-package
```

### Update

Update package content:

```shell
yalc update my-package
```

### Remove

Remove a package from your project:

```shell
yalc remove my-package
```

## Advanced Usage

Take your package development to the next level with advanced Yalc features:

- **Automatic Updates**: Propagate package updates to all installations with `yalc push`, simplifying package management across projects.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune your workflow with options like `--pure` for minimal intrusion into `package.json` or `--workspace` for compatibility with yarn workspaces.
- **Clean-Up**: Keep your project clean with `yalc installations clean`, removing obsolete package installations.

## Conclusion

Yalc revolutionizes package development by offering a seamless and efficient workflow for managing locally developed packages. Say goodbye to dependency resolution headaches and compatibility issues â€“ embrace Yalc and elevate your package development experience.
