Nowadays, maintaining clean and efficient JavaScript projects is crucial. However, identifying and removing dangling files and unused dependencies can be challenging. This is where unimported comes to the rescue.

## Overview

Unimported is a powerful tool designed to detect unused source files and dependencies in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. While linters can flag unused code within modules, they often fail to identify redundant files. Unimported addresses this gap by analyzing your codebase through require/import statements, starting from your entry file.

### How it Works

Unimported follows import statements from one or more entry files, providing a comprehensive report on unimported files, unresolved imports, and unused dependencies. Let's explore its usage and features:

## Usage

To get started, simply run the following command in the root of your project:

```shell
npx unimported
```

Unimported analyzes your codebase, providing valuable insights into unimported files and unused dependencies. Here are some key options and commands you can utilize:

### Init

Initialize default ignore patterns to the `.unimportedrc.json` settings file:

```shell
npx unimported --init
```

### Update

Write current results to the ignore lists in `.unimportedrc.json`:

```shell
npx unimported --update
```

### Fix

Automatically remove unimported files from your project:

```shell
npx unimported --fix
```

### Flow Type

Strip flow types from files containing the `@flow` pragma:

```shell
npx unimported --flow
```

### CI Usage

Integrate unimported into your CI pipeline for automated checks:

```shell
npx unimported
```

## Report

Unimported provides a detailed report outlining unimported files, unresolved imports, and unused dependencies. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

```shell
Summary:
- Entry files: 2
- Unresolved imports: 2
- Unused dependencies: 29
- Unimported files: 86
```

## Example Config File

Customize unimported's behavior by configuring `.unimportedrc.json`. Define entry points, extensions, ignore patterns, and more:

```json
{
  "entry": ["src/main.ts", "src/pages/**/*.{js,ts}"],
  "extensions": [".ts", ".js"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/node_modules/**", "private/**"],
  "ignoreUnresolved": ["some-npm-dependency"],
  "ignoreUnimported": ["src/i18n/locales/en.ts", "src/i18n/locales/nl.ts"],
  "ignoreUnused": ["bcrypt", "create-emotion"],
  "respectGitignore": true,
  "scannedDirs": ["./modules"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

### Export Default

Replace `export default from` with `export { default } from` if encountered.

### Stale Cache

Clear the cache if experiencing unexpected results:

```shell
npx unimported --clear-cache
```

### TypeScript Declaration Files

Include `.d.ts` extensions in your config for TypeScript projects:

```json
{
  "extensions": [".ts", ".d.ts"]
}
```

## Conclusion

Unimported simplifies the process of identifying and removing dangling files and unused dependencies in your JavaScript projects. By integrating it into your workflow, you can ensure cleaner, more efficient codebases. Give it a try and experience the benefits firsthand!
